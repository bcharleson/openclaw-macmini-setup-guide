## Description

Conduct comprehensive customer discovery, develop detailed buyer personas, and gather market intelligence to inform product, marketing, and sales strategies. This skill helps teams understand who their customers are, what they need, and how to reach them effectively.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when users ask about:
- Creating buyer personas or ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles)

- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) analysis
- Market segmentation
- Competitive positioning
- Customer pain point identification
- Value proposition development
- Go-to-market strategy research

## Prerequisites

Before starting customer research, gather:
- **Existing Customer Data**: CRM records, support tickets, sales conversations
- **Company Information**: Your product/service, target market, competitors
- **Research Goals**: What decisions will this research inform?
- **Resources**: Budget, time, access to customers
- **Stakeholders**: Who needs to be involved or informed?

## Instructions

### 1. Define Research Objectives

Ask the user:
- What specific questions are you trying to answer?
- What decisions will this research inform?
- Who is your current target audience? (if any)
- What do you already know about your customers?
- What are your biggest assumptions that need validation?

### 2. Identify Research Methods

Choose appropriate methods:

**Quantitative Methods:**
- Surveys (100+ responses for statistical significance)
- Product usage data and analytics
- Market sizing and TAM/SAM/SOM analysis
- A/B tests and experiments
- CRM and sales data analysis

**Qualitative Methods:**
- Customer interviews (10-20 for patterns)
- Jobs-to-be-Done interviews
- Focus groups (6-10 participants)
- Ethnographic research (observation)
- Customer advisory boards
- Win/loss analysis

**Secondary Research:**
- Industry reports (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Competitor analysis
- Review site mining (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius)
- Social media listening
- Support ticket analysis

### 3. Create Interview Guide

For customer interviews, prepare:

**Opening (5 min):**
- Thank them for their time
- Explain purpose and how you'll use insights
- Get consent to record (if applicable)
- Build rapport with small talk

**Background (10 min):**
- Role and responsibilities
- Company size and industry
- How long they've been in role
- Their goals and KPIs

**Discovery (30 min):**
- Walk me through your workflow for [process]
- What challenges do you face with [problem area]?
- How are you solving this today?
- What have you tried in the past?
- What would make this easier/better?
- Tell me about the last time you [struggled with X]

**Solution Discussion (10 min):**
- How do you evaluate solutions for this problem?
- Who else is involved in the decision?
- What would make you switch from your current solution?
- What would your ideal solution look like?

**Closing (5 min):**
- Is there anything else I should know?
- Who else should I talk to?
- Can I follow up with clarifying questions?
- Thank you and next steps

### 4. Conduct Interviews

Best practices:
- **Ask open-ended questions**: "Tell me about..." vs "Do you like..."
- **Listen more than talk**: 80/20 rule
- **Dig deeper**: "Can you tell me more about that?"
- **Silence is okay**: Let them think and elaborate
- **No leading questions**: "How do you handle X?" not "Do you struggle with X?"
- **Follow the energy**: When they get excited, dig deeper
- **Take notes**: Record for accuracy, but also write key quotes

### 5. Analyze Findings

Synthesize insights:
- **Transcribe interviews**: Use AI tools (Otter, Fireflies, Grain)
- **Tag themes**: Pain points, goals, behaviors, objections
- **Look for patterns**: What do 70%+ of respondents mention?
- **Create affinity map**: Group related insights
- **Identify outliers**: Unique insights worth exploring
- **Quantify when possible**: "8 out of 10 mentioned..."

## Analysis Frameworks

### Affinity Mapping

Group insights by theme:
1. Write each insight on a virtual sticky note
2. Group similar insights together
3. Name each group (theme)
4. Look for patterns across groups
5. Prioritize themes by frequency and impact

### Pattern Recognition

Look for:
- **Frequency**: How many people mentioned this?
- **Intensity**: How strongly do they feel about it?
- **Consistency**: Does it show up across segments?
- **Actionability**: Can we do something about it?

### Segment Analysis

Compare findings across segments:
- By company size (SMB vs Mid-market vs Enterprise)
- By industry
- By role
- By geography
- By use case

## Metrics to Track

Help users measure research quality:
- **Sample size**: Number of interviews/responses
- **Response rate**: For surveys (target: 20-30%)
- **Interview completion rate**: Full interviews vs dropoffs
- **Saturation point**: When new interviews stop revealing new insights
- **Actionability score**: % of findings that inform decisions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Talking more than listening** - Keep 80/20 rule
❌ **Leading questions** - "Don't you think X is a problem?"
❌ **Only talking to friendly customers** - Include detractors
❌ **Ignoring contradictory data** - Don't just look for confirmation
❌ **Skipping synthesis** - Raw notes aren't insights
❌ **Creating personas from assumptions** - Base on real research
❌ **Making it too complicated** - Start simple, add detail as needed

## Advanced Techniques

### Continuous Discovery

Make research ongoing:
- Weekly customer interviews (at least 1)
- Automated feedback loops (NPS, CSAT)
- Usage analytics review
- Support ticket themes
- Sales call recordings

### Assumption Mapping

Identify and test assumptions:
1. List all assumptions about customers
2. Rate each: Confidence (high/medium/low) and Impact (high/medium/low)
3. Prioritize testing low-confidence, high-impact assumptions
4. Design experiments to validate or invalidate

### Kano Model Analysis

Categorize features/attributes:
- **Basic**: Expected, absence causes dissatisfaction
- **Performance**: More is better, linear satisfaction
- **Delight**: Unexpected, presence causes satisfaction
- **Indifferent**: Doesn't affect satisfaction
- **Reverse**: Presence causes dissatisfaction

## Integration Tips

This skill works well with:
- **Interview tools**: Zoom, Google Meet, Calendly
- **Transcription**: Otter.ai, Fireflies, Grain
- **Survey tools**: Typeform, SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics
- **Analysis tools**: Dovetail, Airtable, Miro
- **CRM**: Salesforce, HubSpot for customer data
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics
